Ideanet is a blockchain-based decentralized protocol that aims to provide a secure, scalable and robust device management system for carriers and communications service providers (CSP) to automate the deployment. INET Token is the fuel of the Ideanet ecosystem which is used to pay the network fee and it can also be used to redeem limited benefits. Users can attach any device to the decentralised Ideanet ecosystem and a fee can be paid in the form of an INET Token. Users can also mine INET Tokens by stacking them.
